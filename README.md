a coarse understanding of the problem

- highest-level abstraction: a universal model/language for knowledge/structure representation
  - assumption: human as a species still evolving on earth (except astronauts working in international space station), there are some high-level consensus that holds true for almost all individuals, thus can be learned from all sources of truth indifferently
    - physical laws / laws of the currently observable universe centered around earth
    - predicate logic
      , an oversimplification of evolution of the universe (or our minds as "micro universes") where continuum is non-exist (with nothing to fill in the gap between True and False)
      , and an manifestation of inductively accumulated effect of physical laws
- mid-level abstraction: domain-specific language (vague, need to commit to an ontological understanding of the universe / a tree-structured taxonomy of all domains, mostly works because there are a few already in academia)
  - formal and symbolic systems which are structured closely to the committed domain
  - natural languages: domain-specific vocabulary/terminologies, the way people structure their sentences could vary across domains especially in written literatures
  - might need to separate different media (fiction vs non-fiction, news vs literatures, etc.)
- low-level abstraction: natural language
  - certain degree of consensus across all domains syntactically (the saying "I understand every single word in the sentence but I don't understand what he's talking about", syntactical structures captured, but the higher-order semantics/knowledge not)



Ultimate Goal

- machines being able to extract higher-level abstraction from written sources
